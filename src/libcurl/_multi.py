#  This is an "external" header file. Don't give away any internals here!
#
#  GOALS
#
#  o Enable a "pull" interface. The application that uses libcurl decides where
#    and when to ask libcurl to get/send data.
#
#  o Enable multiple simultaneous transfers in the same thread without making it
#    complicated for the application.
#
#  o Enable the application to select() on its own file descriptors and curl's
#    file descriptors simultaneous easily.

# This header file should not really need to include "curl.h" since curl.h
# itself includes this file and we expect user applications to do #include
# <curl/curl.h> without the need for especially including multi.h.
#
# For some reason we added this include here at one point, and rather than to
# break existing (wrongly written) libcurl applications, we leave it as-is
# but with this warning attached.
#include "curl.h"

# Name:    curl_multi_cleanup()
#
# Desc:    Cleans up and removes a whole multi stack. It does not free or
#          touch any individual easy handles in any way. We need to define
#          in what state those handles will be if this function is called
#          in the middle of a transfer.

# Name:    curl_multi_info_read()
#
# Desc:    Ask the multi handle if there's any messages/informationals from
#          the individual transfers. Messages include informationals such as
#          error code from the transfer or just the fact that a transfer is
#          completed. More details on these should be written down as well.
#
#          Repeated calls to this function will return a new struct each
#          time, until a special "end of msgs" struct is returned as a signal
#          that there is no more to get at this point.
#
#          The data the returned pointer points to will not survive calling
#          curl_multi_cleanup().
#
#          The 'CURLMsg' struct is meant to be very simple and only contain
#          very basic information. If more involved information is wanted,
#          we will provide the particular "transfer handle" in that struct
#          and that should/could/would be used in subsequent
#          curl_easy_getinfo() calls (or similar). The point being that we
#          must never expose complex structs to applications, as then we'll
#          undoubtably get backwards compatibility problems in the future.
#
# Returns: A pointer to a filled-in struct, or NULL if it failed or ran out
#          of structs. It also writes the number of messages left in the
#          queue (after this read) in the integer the second argument points
#          to.

# Name:    curl_multi_strerror()
#
# Desc:    The curl_multi_strerror function may be used to turn a CURLMcode
#          value into the equivalent human readable error string.  This is
#          useful for printing meaningful error messages.
